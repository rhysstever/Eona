## Key Figures
### Thallan Aera
High Elf, Sorcerer  
Impersonated Folen Carro as the precautionary mage, giving him access to the meeting room to set the Delayed Blast Fireball.  

## Misc
### Pact of Zaas
If kidnapped, a member will take their own life using the Pact of Zaas: a verbal ritual spell (usually said in Abyssal): “When a secret is known, the secret has died. I am known, so I must now die.” If the verbal component is completed, necrotic energy wells up in their eyes and spreads through their body. The ritual can be stopped using Counterspell (this spell is considered a 3rd-level spell), or by physically or magically silencing the Order of Whispers member.
