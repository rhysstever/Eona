### Pact of Zaas
If kidnapped, a member will take their own life using the Pact of Zaas: a verbal ritual spell (usually said in Abyssal): “If a secret is shared, it is no longer secret. I have been seen, so I must be no longer.” If the verbal component is completed, necrotic energy wells up in their eyes and spreads through their body. The ritual can be stopped using Counterspell (this spell is considered a 3rd-level spell), or by physically or magically silencing the Order of Whispers member.
