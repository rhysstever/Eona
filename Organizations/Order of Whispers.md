# Order of Whispers
The Order of Whispers is a secret organization that worships the evil deity [[Deities of Eona#Zaas the Whispered One | Zaas, the Whispered One]]. 

## Explosion in Opira
The Order of Whispers are responsible for the [[Explosion in Opira]]. 

## Pact of Zaas
If kidnapped, a member will take their own life using the Pact of Zaas: a verbal ritual spell (usually said in Abyssal): “When a secret is known, the secret has died. I am known, so I must now die.” If the verbal component is completed, necrotic energy wells up in their eyes and spreads through their body. The ritual can be stopped using Counterspell (this spell is considered a 3rd-level spell), or by physically or magically silencing the Order of Whispers member.

## Goals
- Disrupt the major governments of [[Ezavriel]]
- Remain hidden/avoid public view ([[Order of Whispers#Pact of Zaas | Pact of Zaas]])

## Relationships
The Order is an enemy to all governments and major, public organizations. Due to this, they know to stay hidden with any plans or meetings. 

## Key Figures
### Thallan Aera
High Elf, Sorcerer
