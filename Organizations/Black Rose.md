# Black Rose
The Black Rose is a guild that works out of the [[Yhorian Empire]]. It operates similar to an array of underground organizations: thieving, probing for information, and (occasionally) taking out a target. Its headquarters is the Black Rose Inn in the [[Yhora (City)#Highgarden | Highgarden District]] in [[Yhora (City) | Yhora]]. 

## Assassin's Code
All agents of the Black Rose take an oath upon gaining membership to the organization. They are required to follow the code strictly. If the code is broken, they are tried in front of the rest of the organization. Punishment can be as severe as execution. 
- Only kill to spare the lives of others
- Only kill those who are able to defend themselves
- No use of poisons
- If someone is an obstacle, incapacitate them only whenever possible

## Types of Assignments
Agents of the Black Rose will receive missions to carry out. They are divided into three distinct categories and are detailed below: 
- Intel: use espionage, infiltrate, and gather information on an organization or individual
- Retrieval: steal goods or rescue a target
- Neutralize: kill the assigned target(s) or takedown an organization

## Goals
- Control the political atmosphere of the [[Yhorian Empire]] and the greater [[Ezavriel]] region
- Remove those in power that use their power for evil  

## Relationships
The Black Rose has several fingers in the [[Yhorian Empire]]. Many members of the Yhora family and other prominent families have heard the name, but most know it as the lavish inn located in the [[Yhora (City)#Highgarden | Highgarden District]]. Only a handful have had dealings with them, usually in the form of providing information that they've acquired in their high seat in society.
