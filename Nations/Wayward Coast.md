# Wayward Coast
The Wayward (WAI-WAR-D) Coast is a small nation on the south western tip of [[Ezavriel]]. The nation controls many small islands throughout the ocean, namely the Wayward Isles. It's capital, [[Esila]], sits on the mainland of [[Ezavriel]]. It is where the Empress and her Archpriests reside. 

Due to the geography of the nation, citizens' daily lives revolve around sea life. Common occupations include: crew working on a ship, dockhands loading and unloading shipments, and merchants selling acquired goods. 

Society in the Wayward Coast is intertwined in religious worship. Citizens can only progress by furthering their connection with the Empress and her connection to [[Deities of Eona#Atal the All-Bright | Atal the All-Bright]] and [[Deities of Eona#Yher the Dark One | Yher the Dark One]]. 

## History
### The Coast's Beginnings

### Opirian Control
- Eventually the Opirian Alliance takes control (maybe uses airships)

## Goals
- Provide for the citizens of the Wayward Coast
- Spread the words of [[Deities of Eona#Atal the All-Bright | Atal the All-Bright]] and [[Deities of Eona#Yher the Dark One | Yher the Dark One]]
- Promote the Wayward Coast as a continental presence 

## Relationships
Most citizens of the Wayward Coast follow the teachings of [[Deities of Eona#Atal the All-Bright | Atal the All-Bright]] and [[Deities of Eona#Yher the Dark One | Yher the Dark One]] and, thus the Empress's rule. Non-believers usually feel societal pressure to worship and many convert. The Empress is regarded as an extension of Atal and Yher, so most people consider them at least part deity.

Most nations regard the Wayward Coast as a distant, small land of sailors. Other governments will meet with and show respect to the Empress, but the Wayward Coast is frequently left out of decisions due to their distance from the other capitals.
