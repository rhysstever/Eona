> TODO: General culture

## Goals
- Provide for the citizens of the Wayward Coast
- Spread the words of [[Deities of Eona#Atal the All-Bright | Atal the All-Bright]] and [[Deities of Eona#Yher the Dark One | Yher the Dark One]]
-  Promote the Wayward Coast as a continental presence 

## Relationships
Most citizens of the Wayward Coast follow the teachings of [[Deities of Eona#Atal the All-Bright | Atal the All-Bright]] and [[Deities of Eona#Yher the Dark One | Yher the Dark One]] and, thus the Empress's rule. Non-believers usually feel societal pressure to worship and many convert. Those who refuse, no longer. The Empress is regarded as an extension of Atal and Yher, so they themself is seen as partway to godhood. 

Most nations regard the Wayward Coast as a distant, small land of sailors. Other governments will meet with and show respect to the Empress, but the Wayward Coast is frequently left out of decisions due to their distance from the other capitals.
