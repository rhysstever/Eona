# Kandallo
Kandallo (KAHN-DOL-O) is the northwest nation of [[Ezavriel]]. Its capital is [[Ithilmore]] and that is where the Council of Elders meet.

Kandallans value imagination and free-spiritedness. Due to Kandallo's location, the nation faces occasional extreme weather from the North Sea. This requires many settlements, even [[Ithilmore]], to rebuild. While most cultures could not sustain such rebuilding, the Kandallans have learned over the generations to use the Willowdust Woods as a natural protection.  

## Goals
- Preserve the life and history of the Kandallian people
- Support all life so it can thrive and prosper 

## Relationships
Citizens of Kandallo respect the elders as they have usually been around much longer than anyone else. The eiders wisdom is unquestioned and followed by all. While they do not speak for the deities, the elders are seen as deities' chosen.

The knowledge, ideals, and philosophy of the elders are listened by all governments across [[Ezavriel]]. From a commoner to a king, in any nation, the presence of an elder is regarded as an honor.
