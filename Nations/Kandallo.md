# Kandallo
Kandallo (KAHN-DOL-O) is the northwest nation of [[Ezavriel]]. Its capital is [[Ithilmore]] and that is where the Council of Elders meet.

Kandallans value imagination and free-spiritedness. Due to Kandallo's location, the nation faces occasional extreme weather from the North Sea. This requires many settlements, even [[Ithilmore]], to rebuild. While most cultures could not sustain such rebuilding, the Kandallans have learned over the generations to use the Willowdust Woods as a natural protection.
