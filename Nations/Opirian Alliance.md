The Opirian (OH-PEER-EE-AN) Alliance is a collection of ports in the center of [[Ezavriel]]. It is capital is [[Opira]], though other notable settlements in the alliance include [[Yalos]] and [[Port Qane]].

## Goals
- Be the center of Ezavrielian trade
- Financially strengthen each of the major port settlements
- Better the lives of the hard-working citizens

## Relationships
The goals of the government extend to the citizens that the republic governs. Most people that live within the alliance seek opportunity and are willing work hard for it. They elect their officials, so they know their goals and ideals align with those making the rules. 

The Opirian Alliance is placed in the center of [[Ezavriel]]. This makes cross-continental trade by other nations almost impossible without dealing with the alliance. Ports cities and towns in the alliance usually act as a middle figure between nations, and thus, can take their cut of the overall deal. Other nations begrudgingly agree, as otherwise no trade would happen at all.
