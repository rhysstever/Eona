# Opirian Alliance
The Opirian (OH-PEER-EE-an) Alliance is a collection of ports in the center of [[Ezavriel]]. It is capital is [[Opira]], though other notable settlements in the alliance include [[Yalos]] and [[Port Qane]]. Representatives are elected from each of these major port towns and meet in [[Opira]] to form the Opirian Republic. This governing body makes decision for the entire nation, usually in regards to deals with other nations. 

Due to the structure of their government, elected officials within the Opirian Alliance extend the goals and values of its citizens. Those raised in the alliance are quickly taught values of fortitude and tirelessness. They believe hard work and determination can achieve any goal. 

## History
### The Alliance Creation

### The Yhorian-Opirian War

### Post War Alliance

## Goals
- Be the center of Ezavrielian trade
- Financially strengthen each of the major port settlements
- Better the lives of the hard-working citizens

## Relationships
Elected officials of the republic are respected by most citizens. They are trusted to make fair and just laws, knowing they can be removed if they do otherwise. Most people that live within the alliance seek opportunity and are willing work hard for it. Through their ability to elect their officials, citizens feel their goals and ideals are heard and align with those making the rules. 

The Opirian Alliance is placed in the center of [[Ezavriel]]. This makes cross-continental trade by other nations almost impossible without dealing with the alliance. Ports cities and towns in the alliance usually act as a middle figure between nations, and thus, can take their cut of the overall deal. Other nations begrudgingly agree, as otherwise no trade would happen at all.
