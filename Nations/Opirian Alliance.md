# Opirian Alliance
The Opirian ("OH-PEER-EE-AN") Alliance is a collection of ports in the center of [[Ezavriel]]. It is capital is [[Opira]], though other notable settlements in the alliance include [[Yalos]] and [[Port Qane]]. Representatives are elected from each of these major port towns and meet in [[Opira]] to form the Opirian Republic. This governing body makes decision for the entire nation, usually in regards to deals with other nations. 

Values of the Great Alliance are that of the individual. From its creation, the power and liberty of the people has been held above the power of the governing body. While a republic was eventually established, as the first pioneers recognized that some form of government was needed, its power is limited. Officials must adequately represent those that elected them, or they will swiftly be replaced. 

Whether a citizen dreams of being such representative, or head deckhand, they are sure to know the only way to achieve such goal: through their own will and determination. A lazy worker will be unemployed throughout the alliance. 

## Relationships
Elected officials of the republic are respected by most citizens. They are trusted to make fair and just laws, knowing they can be removed if they do otherwise. Most people that live within the alliance seek opportunity and are willing work hard for it. Through their ability to elect their officials, citizens feel their goals and ideals are heard and align with those making the rules. 

The Opirian Alliance is placed in the center of [[Ezavriel]]. This makes cross-continental trade by other nations almost impossible without dealing with the alliance. Ports cities and towns in the alliance usually act as a middle figure between nations, and thus, can take their cut of the overall deal. Other nations begrudgingly agree, as otherwise no trade would happen at all.
