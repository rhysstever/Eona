# Yhorian Empire
The Yhorian ("Y-OR-EE-AN") Empire was the largest and most dominate nation in [[Ezavriel]]. It has ruled as a monarchy under the Yhora family for over 2000 years. They govern from their home and capital of their empire: [[Yhora (City)]].

The Yhoras have created a stable life for many throughout their empire. They have achieve safety through an abundant military and policies of justice, gaining the trust and support of the populous. For the commoner, the empire is a safe place, far from any roving bandits, plundering pirates, or terrifying monstrosities. The royal family is regarded with celebrity status as the common folk live their wildest dreams vicariously through them. 

## Relationships
To the common citizen, the Yhorian Empire is a strong, extensive governing body that gives them opportunity and comfort. As long as laws are followed, people under Yhorian rule can live their lives with little fear of catastrophe and danger.  

From its inception, the Yhorian Empire has been able to flourish and be a major nation of [[Ezavriel]]. Its immense military power and vast trade networks allow the state to maintain its dominant presence. Dreams of full continental control dance in the minds of every member of the Yhora family. While they wish to eventually rule all across [[Ezavriel]], the royal family recognizes the use of other nations.

## History
### The Rise of the Yhorian Empire
Thestros Yhora I founded the town of Yhora in what would be known as the [[Founding of Yhora]]. He appealed to the populous as a charismatic, and intelligent leader. He preached safety through unity, forming a well-trained army that secured lands all around [[Yhora (City)]]. Settlers followed the Yhorian army, establishing towns along main routes back to home city. 

As these towns grew, their developments promoted [[Yhora (City)]], and, not long after, the Yhoras held the first empire of the continent.  

### Going to War and Fall of the Yhorian Empire
The Yhorian Empire went to war against the [[Opirian Alliance]], which would be named the [[Yhorian-Opirian War]]. Ultimately, the [[Opirian Alliance]] defeated  the [[Yhorian Empire]]. The empire's forces were pushed back to their capital, [[Yhora (City)]] and peace was negotiated.  

The [[Yhorian-Opirian War]] marked the end of the [[Yhorian Empire]]. What started as a expansive nation that controlled much of [[Ezavriel]], shriveled to a single remaining city. Public opinion of the Yhoras had plummeted, yet they managed to retain rule over the city.
