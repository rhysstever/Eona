# Yhorian Empire
The Yhorian (y-OR-EE-an) Empire is the largest and most dominate nation in [[Ezavriel]]. It has ruled as a monarchy under the Yhora family for over 2000 years. They govern from their home and capital of their empire: [[Yhora (City) | Yhora]].

The Yhoras have been able to create a stable life for many throughout their empire. Distracted by prospering settlements and thriving trade, the average commoner has forgotten the bloodied history when the Yhora family first rose to power. As long as the empire continues to flourish, the general view of the royal family remains in good light. There will always be those eagerly awaiting their downfall, but that is natural when it comes to long-standing forms of authority.
