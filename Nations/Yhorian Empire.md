# Yhorian Empire
The Yhorian ("Y-OR-EE-AN") Empire is the largest and most dominate nation in [[Ezavriel]]. It has ruled as a monarchy under the Yhora family for over 2000 years. They govern from their home and capital of their empire: [[Yhora (City)]].

The Yhorian royal family have been able to create a stable life for many throughout their empire. Distracted by prospering settlements and thriving trade, the average commoner has forgotten the bloodied history when the Yhora family first rose to power. As long as the empire continues to flourish, the general view of the royal family remains in good light. There will always be those eagerly awaiting their downfall, but that is natural when it comes to long-standing forms of authority. 

## Relationships
To the common citizen, the Yhorian Empire is a strong, extensive governing body that gives them opportunity and comfort. As long as laws are followed, people under Yhorian rule can live their lives with little fear of catastrophe and danger.  

From its inception, the Yhorian Empire has been able to flourish and be a major nation of [[Ezavriel]]. Its immense military power and vast trade networks allow the state to maintain its dominant presence. Dreams of full continental control dance in the minds of every member of the Yhora family. While they wish to eventually rule all across [[Ezavriel]], the royal family recognizes the use of other nations.
