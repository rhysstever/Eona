# Discovery of the Khitonian River
## Reasons to Journey 
When [[Zanapool]] was founded, Yhorian merchants' main route had them sail down the [[Zanapool]] river, then north, heading counter-clockwise around the continent. From there, they would sail west into the Sea of Yhor to [[Yhora (City) | Yhora]]. This route, however, took a long time and exposed ships to the dangerous ocean waters. 

Eager to find a quicker and safer route, PERSON in year YEAR_NUMBER looked to a find an option via land. They knew [[Zanapool]] was built into the southern face of a group of mountains, and these were possibly the same mountains that sat south of [[Adaham]]. 

## Travels
After getting funding from a wealthy Yhorian merchant, NAME sailed from [[Yhora (City) | Yhora]] to [[Zanapool]]. They then set out west of [[Zanapool]], staying close to southern edge of mountains.

## Results
NAME returned to [[Yhora (City) | Yhora]] with their notes and findings, sending their results to their patron and then releasing it to the public. Although their entire journey took JOURNEY_LENGTH, NAME calculated this new land route to take ROUTE_LENGTH. 

Once NAME's findings hit the public, the [[Yhorian Empire]] swiftly claimed the land west of [[Zanapool]]. Soon, a bridge was built to cross the Khitonian River and many trade routes were established. While some merchants decided to keep their pre-existing sea trade routes, this new land route provided more trade for [[Kanta]] and [[Adaham]].
