# Discovery of the Khitonian River
## Reasons to Journey 
When [[Zanapool]] was founded, Yhorian merchants' main route had them sail down the [[Zanapool]] river, then north, heading counter-clockwise around the continent. From there, they would sail west into the [[Sea of Yhor]] to [[Yhora (City)]]. This route, however, took a long time and exposed ships to the dangerous ocean waters. 

Eager to find a quicker and safer route, [[Jaayfin Oakroot II]] looked to a find an option via land. They knew [[Zanapool]] was built into the southern face of a group of mountains, and these were possibly the same mountains that sat south of [[Adaham]]. 

## Travels
After getting funding from a wealthy Yhorian merchant, [[Jaayfin Oakroot II]] sailed from [[Yhora (City)]] to [[Zanapool]]. He set out west of [[Zanapool]], staying close to southern edge of mountains.

## Results
[[Jaayfin Oakroot II]] returned to [[Yhora (City)]] with his notes and findings, sending his results to his patron and then releasing it to the public. Although the entire journey took close to a year, [[Jaayfin Oakroot II]]'s new land route to [[Zanapool]] would be much quicker. 

Once [[Jaayfin Oakroot II]]'s findings hit the public, the [[Yhorian Empire]] swiftly claimed the land west of [[Zanapool]]. Soon, a bridge was built to cross the Khitonian River and many trade routes were established. While some merchants decided to keep their pre-existing sea trade routes, this new land route provided much safer trade throughout the eastern region of the [[Yhorian Empire]], bolstering to economies of [[Kanta]] and [[Adaham]].
