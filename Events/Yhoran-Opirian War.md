# Yhoran-Opirian War
The Yhoran-Opirian War, sometimes shortened to the YEOA War ("YEE-OH-UH"), lasted from 1453 to 1454. It is also sometimes known as the "10 Years War".

## Cause 
Closely related to [[Explosion in Opira]], [[Thestros Yhora III]] was murdered in the dungeons of [[Opira]], the capital of the [[Opirian Alliance]]. An investigation conducted by the [[Opirian Alliance]] revealed cause from an anarchist group called, the [[Order of Whispers]]. Despite these findings, the [[Yhoran Empire]] held the Opirian officials at fault for Thetros's death. 

As tensions grew between the already rival nations, the [[Yhoran Empire]] soon implemented tariffs on any Opirian imports. Knowing they were the alliance's biggest exporter, the [[Yhoran Empire]] began a economic war to weaken the [[Opirian Alliance]]. These tariffs were later raised to further upset Opirian merchants and traders. 

On one fateful day, the Opal, an official Opirian merchant ship, was sailing out of the [[Sea of Yhor]]. Before it could reach the Yhoran strait, the vessel exploded in a large fireball. Everyone onboard was killed from the blast or drowned in the sea. While the [[Yhoran Empire]] claimed the event's cause to be from pirates, many [[Opirian Alliance]] traders swore it was further retaliation from the empire for the [[Explosion in Opira]]. 

## Initial Fighting
The beginning of the war was controlled by the [[Yhoran Empire]]. Having forces already present in each of their major towns and cities, the empire could out maneuver and overwhelm any land troops the [[Opirian Alliance]] had. The Empire moved its forces aggressively, as it historically always had, relying on its sheer size. 

## Turning the Tide
While the Yhoran military excelled on land, the Opirian forte was the sea. The [[Yhoran Empire]] quickly reinforced its borders and even pushed into the area south of [[Eighwood]], knocking on the door of [[Opira]]. This however, proved to be one of the empire's first major mistakes. Soon after the Yhoran's push to right outside of [[Opira]], Opirian forces were deployed from the north sea. Suddenly, the main Yhoran forces were surrounded with no way out. 

The geographical advantage of the [[Opirian Alliance]] only continued to aid the alliance's war effort. While one Yhoran battalion marched towards [[Opira]], another aimed to take [[Port Qane]]. The plan was to gather in [[Kanta]], march through the [[Empty Valley]], and storm the port city. On paper, this was a great plan. No one uses the [[Empty Valley]], for it was far too dangerous to traverse. The [[Opirian Alliance]] was certainly focused on defending its capital and would not expect a land assault on [[Port Qane]]. The Yhoran officers, however, greatly underestimated the danger the valley posed. They figured they had the strength to plow right through to [[Port Qane]], no matter what hid in the [[Empty Valley]]. Yet the Yhoran battalion never reached [[Port Qane]]. Only a handful of soldiers returned to [[Kanta]] and those that did spoke of the horrors that lay in the valley. Broken stories of creatures that had only ever been mentioned in legends and myths. 

With these two major blunders, the [[Yhoran Empire]] showed weakness. They showed to every nation that there were flaws within the supposed magnificent empire. 

The war unofficially ended when Opirian ships entered the [[Sea of Yhor]]. At this point, the [[Yhoran Empire]] could only defend its capital. All of [[Ezavriel]] watched as the [[Opirian Alliance]] sailed around the sea, taking major settlements, including [[Kanta]], [[Adaham]], and eventually even [[Zanapool]]. 

[[Yhora (City)]] was left all by itself. The remaining Yhoran guard regrouped, ready to defend the royal family against any Opirian siege. The siege, however, never came. Both Opirian and Yhoran forces knew taking [[Yhora (City)]] would be a bloodbath. So, instead, the [[Opirian Alliance]] drafted a treaty. 

The treaty required the [[Yhoran Empire]] to relinquish control of all of its major settlements, outside of its capital. It stated that [[Eighwood]] would officially be under the control of the [[Opirian Alliance]]. All other remaining major settlements were freed from Yhoran rule, but were required to become trade partners with the alliance. The Yhorans, backs against their keep walls, signed the treaty, officially ending the war.
