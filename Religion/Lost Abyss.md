# Lost Abyss
- Domain of [[Deities of Eona#Yher the Dark One| Yher, the Dark One]]
- An infinite graveyard
	- Houses a grave for every dead person
	- Each gravestone is the same, with the name of the person and the date they died
- Dim atmosphere 
	- Perpetual dark-gray sky
	- Cracked, dry dirt ground
	- Occasional howling wind blows by (each time a person dies)
- Floating cloaked figures patrol with giant scythes
