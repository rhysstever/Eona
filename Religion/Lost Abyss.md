# Lost Abyss
The Lost Abyss is the domain of [[Deities of Eona#Yher the Dark One|Yher, the Dark One]]. It appears to souls as an endless graveyard, filled with gravestones. Every gravestone appears the same, differing only by the soul's name and dates they were born and died. 

Visually, the Abyss is a haunting and depressing location. It has a perpetual dark gray sky and the ground is cracked and desolate. Floating around the graveyard, large cloaked figures patrol with massive scythes.
