# Eternal Atrium
The Eternal Atrium is the domain and home plane of Unus, the All-Knowing ([[Deities of Eona]]). It appears as an infinite and over-sized library. For example, books are over 3 feet tall. 

The Atrium is usually bustling with robed followers of Unus. They are constantly searching for tomes to add new pieces of knowledge to or to update outdated ones.
