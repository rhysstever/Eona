# Eona
This repo is where I am storing notes for my homebrew Dungeons and Dragons world, Eona. I am using [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) to organize everything, and it mainly uses markdown for each note file.

I outline continents, major nations, points of interest, key people, and much more within Eona. I also keep track of campaigns and one-shots I run within this setting. If you are a player in any of these adventures, please refrain from looking within the Adventures folder.

## Viewing Published Notes PSA
You can view the published notes [here](https://eona.netlify.app/)! If you, however, do keep some things in mind: 
1. **Broken Links**: If a link does not work, it means the corresponding note is not published. It could some work, only need a few tweaks, or not even be created yet. However, if it is a link you can navigate to, I am most likely prioritizing it and it should be published soon
2. **Tables**: I use a number of community plugins, two of which being: one to publish my notes onto the site you can see, and the another being one that helps format tables. Because they are separate plugins, however, they don't always work hand-in-hand. If the table text is long enough, the spacing breaks down and the table looks squished. So some tables will look quite funky
3. **Timeline**: the [[Timeline of Ezavriel]]
