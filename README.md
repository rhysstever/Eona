# Eona

This repo is where I am storing notes for my homebrew Dungeons and Dragons world, Eona. I am using [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) to organize everything, and it mainly uses markdown for each note file.

I outline continents, major nations, points of interest, key people, and much more within Eona. I also keep track of campaigns and one-shots I run within this setting. If you are a player in any of these adventures, please refrain from looking within the Adventures folder.

## Viewing Published Notes PSA
You can view the published notes [here](https://eona.netlify.app/)! If you, however, do keep some things in mind: 
1. **Broken Links**: If a link does not work, it means the corresponding note is not published. It could some work, only need a few tweaks, or not even be created yet. However, if it is a link you can navigate to, I am most likely prioritizing it and it should be published soon
2. **Timeline**: the Timeline of Ezavriel looks off because it can only render with Obsidian. Because of this, I have included a screenshot of what it should look like, so it can still be viewed from the web browser.
