## History
### Personal
Arthic was an unexpected child, but a welcome one for the budding romance of his parents. Though Araseli cared for him, she was often unable to express it, unsure how to parent him other than the tried and true path of private education that his siblings had followed. However, R was a poor student in front of most tutors, learning quickly but often misbehaving, escaping lessons, and pulling pranks in the hopes of earning a glimmer of attention from his endlessly busy mother or absent siblings. Unfortunately, this only solidified a negative opinion of R as a childish troublemaker in the minds of his siblings - if they even thought of him at all. Instead, he found respite with Samuel, and was awarded the occasional tutoring lesson with Harmony if she had the time for it. Though R has far from mastered the military arts, their constant sneaking about in order to overhear private conversations between Araseli and her important guests have paid off in a unique skill set of stealth and deception. In addition to this, they frequently snuck off and out of the manor onto the streets of [[Yhora (City) | Yhora]] in disguise, learning more about the culture of the common folk and growing disgust for oppressive political systems.

Now at the age of 26, Arthic’s mother has arranged for R to take up a position as a scribe for his brother Valor, an act of blatant nepotism but a strategic move to begin his journey following the footsteps of his siblings. Arthic has only been working for Valor for a month, but already hates it. Valor is condescending and self-important, assigning him mind-numbing busywork for the fun of it. Though all the other siblings look up to their deceased elven father Courage, Valor has never cared to meet R’s human father Samuel despite having lived in the same city for decades, and infuriates him with callous remarks about the man’s condition.

In summary, Arthic is a disillusioned young man who feels alone in his own family, making trouble in the hopes that his mother might treat him more like a son and less like a coworker. Though he detests being treated as though he were a child, there is some truth to the sentiment, as he is not as responsible and self-aware as you would expect of a usual 26 year old. While not exactly a star student, R has a unique set of skills from his years of sneaking about the manor at home, allowing him the chance to make this unfortunate assistant position a bit more entertaining for himself. Despite all this, R is a good person at heart, and though he may act as though he couldn’t care less about the status and power of his siblings, R wants nothing more than to prove himself, and to one day make his mother proud.

### Family 
In centuries past, ancestors of the elven Daeren family were involved in the very founding of [[Yhora (City) | Yhora]] itself, earning their family immediate wealth and political respect for as long as they continued their lineage. With the importance of strengthening the family name kept at the forefront of the family’s mind for generations, Araseli Daeren did her best to fulfill this duty by choosing a wealthy and influential elven man as her husband. Between the ages of 300-350, Araseli and her husband Courage had two older daughters and two younger sons.

For the next two hundred years, Araseli employed various tutors to educate her children in order to prepare them to fill political/military positions once they came of age. Each of these four children are now between the ages of 150-200 years old, and highly successful in their fields. The first child Defiance and the fourth child Merit are both actively involved in the military/navy, content and powerful in their own lives and rarely home to visit. The second child, Harmony, has taken specific interest in an arcane education, and still lives at home with Araseli in order to continue studying in peace. The third child, Valor, moved out and secured himself a high ranking political position ten years ago.

However, when their children were roughly 50-100 years old, their father Courage died honorably in military action. After an appropriate period of “mourning” the man she never particularly connected with, Araseli found herself free to explore the possibility of a true romance, meeting the human man Samuel who later became Arthic’s father. Although the pair were deeply in love, they met when Samuel was already nearly 50 years old, and now the elderly Samuel is in the care of the servants at home, nearing the end of his life while his bride has centuries left.
