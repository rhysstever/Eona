## Appearance


## History
Myrdin Craynore was born the younger of the two heirs to House Craynore, one of the politically strongest noble houses in the [[Yhorian Empire]]. His mother, Imra Craynore, died in giving birth to him, a fact that his father, Folmer Craynore, has never been able to forgive. 

Myrdin was raised as noble children traditionally are, given a good education with a focus on languages and economics. Myrdin excelled at languages, but found himself uninterested in the economics and finances of his house, preferring the politics and statecraft that he saw around him. Unfortunately, those duties went to his older sister and heir to House Craynore, Alea. As second-heir, Myrdin's destiny is to help his older sister run the house by balancing books and haggling with merchants. 

Myrdin's dislike of his traditional duties was worsened by the relations with his family members. Alea is often cold to him, similarly blaming him for taking the mother she grew up with, and Folmer treats him as a tool for Alea to use in her eventual rise to power. 

For much of his childhood, Myrdin desperately tried to win their affection with feats of music, sleight-of-hand, or prestidigitation, but when those efforts failed continually, he found refuge in his cousins, House Kelkian. His bardic talents began as a childhood hobby to impress his family, and continued as he trained under Vulmer Kelkian. He considers these skills as half-hobby, half profession, as Vulmer taught him the power of distraction when spying or politicking.

His skills as a rogue began when his cousin Kylantha introduced him to the [[Black Rose]], an assassin's guild of noblemen with a strict honor code. Myrdin respects their code, and remains a low-ranking member, although he is uninterested in assassination or thievery - he enjoys guild membership for its opportunity in spycraft training, including intel missions that he is occasionally sent on. 

His nuclear family has no idea he is a member, although the Kelkians do and support him. After being fired from his family's ledger-work (see Allies), Myrdin got a job as the Yhora family's court-bard. His high noble birth, combined with some subtle recommendations from connections in the [[Black Rose]], and Vulmer's bardic status, allowed him to obtain a prestigious position entertaining events that the Throne of the [[Yhorian Empire]] puts on. 

He also acts as a spy at these events, telling useful political secrets to the ruler. Occasionally, he keeps some secrets to himself, although only ones that help House Kelkian - he freely releases info on his own house, which helps the King and Queen trust him. 

Soon, Myrdin will be attending a meeting of the nations in [[Opira]], acting as "Traditional Court Bard." The King and Queen have allowed him to be there "due to the proud tradition of court bards silently attending important meetings." Of course, they actually want him there to act as a spy, and to sit on the sidelines catching any info or details they miss. He will be spying for the [[Black Rose]] as well, gathering intel for use in their maneuvering.

## Allies
Myrdin's nuclear family relations may be unsteady, but his relations with his cousins in House Kelkian are rock-solid. House Kelkian, a lesser house, is generally ignored in the politics of Yhora, but they provide crucial metal shipments that keep their house as an economic superpower. 

**Raeran Kelkian**, Myrdin's aunt, is not just a brilliant merchant but an expert spy who keeps competitors for their trade at bay with a steady stream of secrets and blackmail. **Vulmer Kelkian**, Myrdin's uncle, is a bard by trade who trained Myrdin in music, prestidigitation, and most importantly, distraction. "Secrets flow freely when music plays loudly" was his favorite phrase. Raeran and Vulmer, however, are generally bound to their never-ending trade duties, and are unlikely to help Myrdin if he is outside the city. 

Myrdin's best friends and cousins are **Theodred and Kylantha Kelkian**, heirs to house Kelkian and ambitiously bad influences. Of course, compared to Myrdin's sheltered and ignored life in house Craynore, anything would be a bad influence - Theodred's scams and Kylantha's connections to the [[Black Rose]] are admittedly worse than "anything," but at their core both are good people practicing their craft. Theodred often gives back what he scams from others, preferring the thrill of the deception itself, and Kylantha takes the most dangerous jobs, usually stealing from corrupt noble houses, considering it as a challenge with something to teach her.

When Theodred and Myrdin were 22, a scam gone wrong led to Myrdin getting an arrow in the right shoulder and another in the knee, not to mention getting fired from correcting his father's ledgers as "your pea-sized mind combined with a fiery spirit is clearly not suited to such useful work." Myrdin was the only one caught, and while he's perfectly fine with that, Theodred feels hugely guilty and has pledged to repay the debt to Myrdin one day. Myrdin maintains a slight limp in his left leg, although he hides it well. Myrdin hasn't seen Kylantha in five years - the last time was just before he got his job as court bard and spy, and one day after finding the dying man in the sewer - but his last memories of her haunt him. She looked gaunt, having completed a heist the night before and clearly not having slept. She told him that she had to go, that only he and her family knew. "No, it wasn't the heist, no-one saw me" she assured him, but her nervous glances showed that something was after her. She gave Myrdin a small glowing stone, and the knowledge that as long as it glowed she was still alive. She promised to come back one day, "In his greatest hour of need", a line so dramatic Myrdin incorporated it into some of his songs. Overall, Myrdin considers the Kelkians to be his true family, and would die to protect them, as well as knowing that he can call on Theodred (or potentially find Kylantha) in an emergency.

## Enemies
Besides his nuclear family, Myrdin doesn't have enemies as such, but he certainly has competitors. He ranks quite low in Yhora's thieves guild, a fact he isn't interested in changing, but his position in Yhora's royal court makes his fellow thieves (and fellow bards) jealous and competitive. Mostly, they're cordial to him, but many of Myrdin's coworkers are looking for a secret that could hurt his reputation and lose him the job.

## Organizations
**House Craynore** is a powerful noble house, wielding politics and control of the lumber and construction trade as bluntly yet effectively as a hammer. Currently, they are subtly vying for the throne of the [[Yhorian Empire]]. 

Myrdin is a low-ranking member of the [[Black Rose]]. He is mostly uninterested in their work of thievery and assassination, but uses them as an opportunity to network with other underground nobles and to practice his spycraft with [[Black Rose]] mentors. He can often be found playing cards in the [[Black Rose]]'s common room, often losing, but still enjoying the conversation and occasionally adding a song to the hubbub.

## Other
On a quiet winter night, Myrdin dashed into the sewers of Yhora, splitting up from Theodred to escape from their latest scam. While down there, he nearly crashed into a disheveled male dwarf whose eyes were bright with fear. The man collapsed, muttering dwarvish that at first sounded like random gibberish words. 

Luckily, Myrdin was able to determine that he was speaking in Thieves' Cant, putting important words here and there while filling the rest with gibberish. Myrdin managed to decode and write down only the words "Evil nears, Yhora sleeps while the wolves come." The dwarf hacked out a last breath and died, poison foaming from his mouth. 

Myrdin has subtly inquired to [[Black Rose]] comrades many times about the incident, but given their rules against poison, he has found nothing that points a finger at them. 

Goals: 
- Become skilled enough in spycraft and bardic power to elevate either himself or house Kelkian politically. He doesn't have a goal of reducing house Craynore's influence, but he wouldn't complain if it happened
- Keep the Yhora family on the throne, as he knows any weakness from them would result in his house taking over
- Discover Kylantha's whereabouts, and find out if her leaving relates to the dead man in the sewer.
