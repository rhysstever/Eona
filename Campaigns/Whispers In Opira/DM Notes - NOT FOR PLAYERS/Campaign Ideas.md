## The Meeting of the Five Nations
- Representatives from each 5 nations gather in [[Opira]] to discuss planning the Opirian Canal
	- Possible/specifc investments from the other 4 nations
	- future trade opportunities once the canal is finished 
- A high level sorcerer of Zaas acts as a guard in the room
	- Casts a delayed fireball using subtle spell
		- Can been seen with bat excrement and sulfur on their hands 
	- Blows up the entire room, killing many, maiming the few rest
- PCs are in the room
- The guards posted on outside of the room are gone

## Clues
- Asking about who checked the meeting room before
	- Folen Carro was the mage who checked the room
	- Folen has gone missing and Thallan Aera impersonated him --> gained access to the meeting room 
- Secret Black Rose Agent 
	- GIVEN - Gives code to R 
		- “NOTWHATHESEEMS” 
		- Decrypted using the attendance list as a bank to an Ottendorf cipher 
		- Slipped into his things while explosion happened 
	- Gives code to Jason 
		- “YOUHAVEFRIENDS” or “YOURENOTALONE” 
		- Used in Polybius cipher 
		- Given in crowded area to shield identity 
	- Gives riddle/poem to group (or R) 
		- Hints at using the attendance list 
		- TODO: Riddle contents 
		- TODO: Way of giving riddle 
- Spying OoW Agent 
	- Has key to Polybius cipher 
	- Has encrypted book of secrets 
		- Only those who answer correctly can read what’s inside or take 1d10 psychic damage 
		- TODO Riddle: 
	- If kidnapped, kills themself via the pact of Zaas: Verbal component (usually said in Abyssal): “If a secret is shared, it is no longer secret. I have been seen, so I must be no longer.” If V comp is completed, necrotic energy wells up in their eyes and spreads thr their body
