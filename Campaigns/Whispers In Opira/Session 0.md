# Session 0
All points and topics I want to cover in the initial 

## Scheduling
- Length: spring semester, ideally 6-8 sessions --> faster-paced
- When works for everyone --> When2Meet
- First session when? (how much time to create character)
- Session length: ~3 hours
- In-person, will cancel if someone cant make the session
 
## Table Expectations 
- Semi-serious (mainly for time), no session can be "wasted"
- No meta-gaming
- Respect everyone's characters
- Respect the time I've put into this story, world, etc
- Respect everyone's boundaries
- Pet peeves
	- Mine
		- Asking for a specific check "Can do a nature check"; exception being insight
	- Ask players
		- ???
- No discrimination world based on race, gender, sexual orientation
	- Only discrimination will be based on social class and religion (less)  

## Campaign Framework
- Setting
	- Medium fantasy, very little tech
	- Eona > Ezavriel > Opira
	- City-based/Urban setting
- More rp and social interaction, less combat
- Mystery genre
- Starting level, perceived ending level: 5 --> ~8
- Short campaign = less character development :(

## House Rules
- Rolls only count if they are on the table
- Leveling: milestone
- Encumbrance
- Ammunition
- Crits: Normal dmg + max amount of each die
- Advantage: flanking (on hexes)
