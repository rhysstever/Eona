# Session 0
All points and topics I want to cover in the initial 

## Scheduling
- Length: spring semester, ideally 6-8 sessions --> faster-paced

- First session when? (how much time to create character)
- Session length: ~3 hours
- In-person, will cancel if someone cant make the session
 
## Table Expectations 
- Tone: Semi-serious (mainly for time), no session can be "wasted"
- Ettiquette
	- No meta-gaming
	- Respect everyone's characters
	- Respect me: the time I've put into this story, world, etc
	- Boundaries
		- Respect 
		- No discrimination world based on race, gender, sexual orientation
			- Only discrimination will be based on social class and religion (less)
		- Players'
			- ???
	- Pet peeves
		- Mine

			- Unprompted rolls for a check you decided you should make ""

## Campaign Framework
- Setting
	- Medium fantasy, very little tech
	- Eona > Ezavriel > Opira
	- City-based/Urban setting
- More rp and social interaction, less combat
	- Rules will be a little different, esp with social interaction
- Mystery genre
- Character Creation
	- Starting level, perceived ending level: 5 --> ~8
	- Stats are rolled: 4d6, removing the lowest 
- Short campaign = less character development :(

## House Rules
- Rolls only count if they are on the table
- Leveling: milestone
- Encumbrance
- Ammunition
- Crits: Normal dmg + max amount of each die
- Advantage: flanking (on hexes)
