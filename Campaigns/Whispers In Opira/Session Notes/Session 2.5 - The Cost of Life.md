# Session 2.5 - The Cost of Life

Date: 3/DD/2022  
Players: [[Sontar Raloran]] and [[Xerthanos Sparklecloak]]

## A Deal with Divinity
- Both "wake up" in a main walkway in the [[Eternal Athenaeum]] 
	- Notice they are ethereal, not in solid bodies --> they are their souls
- Booming, deafening voice comes over them, that only they can hear, Unus
- Has taken interest in them: wants to extend their life so they can continue Unus's work
	- "As followers of me, I watched over you and saw your final moments. I saw you each selflessly put yourself in front of another- putting your own life out for someone you cared about. And that is what caught my interest."
- Has a followup deal 
	- Pledge themself to Unus: take 1 level in Celestial Warlock, in return they will avoid resurrection sickness
	- Can choose to remain a follower without fully pledging, though may encounter resurrection sickness
	- "I offer you a deal: continue your pursuit for knowledge and selfless service and I can extend your life force on the Material Plane. There is still a culprit at large that needs to answer for they crimes. Then and only then your quest is complete, your souls will be able to rest back here, in the Eternal Athenaeum."
