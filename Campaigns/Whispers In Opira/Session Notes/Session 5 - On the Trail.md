## Another Note from Yher
- The night of 20th of Eonum: Yher's response to Xerthanos's prayers:
- Xerthanos wakes up in a void of darkness, illuminated by glowing white beads strung together
	- Each bead, when examined is a person's life: a "time lapse" of them being born, growing up, and passing
	- Feelings of comfort and certainty
- Notices a small group of "muted" beads, of a dark gray
	- When examined, sees rituals and hears prays to the Whispered One
	- Sees the chain of life broken as someone is raised from the dead
		- The humanoid appears more feral, a different consciousness
	- Feelings of anger and hatred when seeing these scenes

## New News

	- "Extra! Extra! Suspect of keep attack taken into custody. Representative challenger and owner of Almon's Almonds, Almon Payeth found both plotted and carried out the murder of several representatives. Opirian investigation closed."
