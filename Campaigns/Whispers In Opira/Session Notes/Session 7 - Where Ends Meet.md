> We call out to the deities of Eona, to recognize those who have been ignored until now:
> 
> The Whispered One, the keeper of secrets. Leering around corners, sulking in alleyways, collecting knowledge only known to few. We worship you and live by your values. You showed us the evils of worldly governments, showed us why no one deserves such power. 
> 
> The Blood-driven, the vengeful. Giving us purpose and strength to do must must be done. What others would fail to do. You gave us the tools to destroy those in power. To topple the largest and strongest so that nothing remains. 
> 
> We stand before you all as devoted followers. 
> 
> We stand before you with an informer, leaking such secrets from their high position, to aid us in our work. 
> 
> We stand before you, with four silenced souls. Gatherers of knowledge, prized officials, and spreaders of information. 
> 
> We stand before you, with two more souls. Condemned for their values of knowledge. May you collect their souls and silence them for eternity.

### Lair Actions
If the full monologue is said, lair actions are created:  
1) **Echoing Whispers.** Whispers echo through the chamber, every hostile creature needs to make a DC 13 Wisdom saving throw. A creature takes 2d6 psychic damage on a failed save, or half as much on a successful save. 
2) **Shrouds of Darkness.** A thick magical darkness forms in between horizontal or vertical pillars. If a creature attempts to walk through the magical darkness, the creature needs to make a DC 15 Charism saving throw. On a failed save, the creature's movement is reduced to 0 and they do not make it through the darkness. While the darkness is magical, spells and other magical effects can still pass through. 
3) **Silenced Laughter.** Zaas's influence peaks within the room. Every creature within room must make a DC 13 Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, a creature is silenced for one round. A silenced creature can not speak and cannot cast any spells that require a verbal component. 

## Post-Combat
- Jason recognizes the other body as Alais Boon, a fellow Black Rose agent, based in the Opirian Alliance
- Folen and Alais Boon has been sacrificed
