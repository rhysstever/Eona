# Faroot Island
Faroot  ("FUH-ROOT") Island is the largest island of [[Ezavriel]]. It hovers south of the [[Opirian Alliance]], straight south from [[Yalos]]. Because the island is even further south than the continent, it has an even warmer climate. Faroot is covered in a dense jungle, with a single, tall mountain breaking through and towering above. 

There a number of tribes that live within the island's jungle. Upon early discovery of the inhabitants, one would note that they share a great bond. A deeper look would reveal, however, that this bond is only created out of distain for outside influence. The inhabitants worship the island as a direct gift from the deities, so any disturbances are taken with great offense.
