# Faroot Island
Faroot Island is the largest island of [[Ezavriel]]. It hovers south of the [[Opirian Alliance]], straight south from [[Yalos]]. Because the island is even further south than the continent, it has an even warmer climate. Faroot is covered in a dense jungle, with a single, tall mountain breaking through and towering above.
