# Empty Valley
From a map, the Empty Valley seems like a perfect route to take from [[Kanta]] of the [[Yhorian Empire]] and [[Port Qane]] of the [[Opirian Alliance]]. Many naive tradesmen believe this as well before learning how the passage got its name. The Empty Valley is known to be a highly dangerous valley. Tales of guilds of bandits and caves to ferocious beasts line the mountains that flank on either side. 

## History
For decades and decades, merchants of both neighboring nations have begged for their governments to send soldiers through the valley to clear it. Most of the time these pleads were ignored, and when they weren't, the soldiers sent would almost never return. 

Trade is still attempted through the Empty Valley, though rarely successful. The only wagons that make it through are those highly guards: protection that only governments or the upper elite can afford.
