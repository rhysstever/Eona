# Mirthvale Swamp
The Mirthvale Swamp, or Mirthvale for short, is a wetland in western [[Ezavriel]]. It is south of the Willowdust Woods and west of [[Opira]]. A mountain range separates the Mirthvale from the [[Wayward Coast]]. The combination of nutrient-rich soil and fresh water runoff from the mountains, allows for ample plant growth throughout the region.
