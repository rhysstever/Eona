# Pyretide Islands
The Pyretide Islands are a string of hotspot islands that parallel the southeastern coast of the continent. Because they are hotspots, the oldest and largest islands are active volcanoes. 

While most could only visit the islands for a single day or two, there are inhabitants that have called the islands home for generations. Due to the harsh conditions, they are some of the most resilient folk in all of [[Ezavriel]].
