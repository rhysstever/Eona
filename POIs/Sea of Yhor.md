# Sea of Yhor
The Sea of Yhor is the largest body of water within [[Ezavriel]]. It sits to the northeast of the continent and is named after the city and royal family, Yhora. The sea feeds connects to the surrounding ocean through a northeast channel, called the Yhorian Channel. 

Due to its size and access to the ocean, numerous settlements are established along its coast, namely, [[Yhora (City)]], [[Kanta]], and [[Adaham]]. The Yhorian Channel can be easily defended by land or sea, ensuring safe trade with no fear of any external threats.
