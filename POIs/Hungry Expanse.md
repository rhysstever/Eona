# Hungry Expanse
The Hungry Expanse controls the southeast of continental [[Ezavriel]]. It is a desert that contains large dunes, nomadic tribes, and other less documented mysteries. A river cuts diagonally through the Hungry Expanse, spouting from the mountains in northeast. The river splits roughly halfway through its journey, before emptying into the ocean to the desert's southwest. At this river's divergence, the city of [[Khiton]] sits, surrounded by great mesas. 

## History
For most of Yhorian history, the [[Hungry Expanse]] was just a large, empty desert. This was accepted as truth until the [[Discovery of the Khitonian River]].
