# Khiton
Khiton ("KEY-TUN") is the capital of the [[Baohua]] nation. 

During the day, Khiton appears more as a large town than a bustling city. Farmers work the fertile land along the river, while guards patrol atop the towering mesas. Some may spot merchants wheeling carts or couriers delivering messages. 

At night is where Khiton magic is truly felt. The streets become filled with anyone and everyone: from a simple commoner to a wealthy estate owner.
