# Ithilmore
Ithilmore ("EH-THILL-MORE") is a large city built inside and around a massive tree. The city is the only major settlement and, thus, as the capitol of [[Kandallo]]. The Council of Elders govern Ithilmore, in addition to the entire nation. 

The tree, named Eona's Hearth by Kandallans, is what the city is most known for. The tree itself stands hundreds of feet tall and sits at the heart of the [[Willowdust Woods]]. Due to its shear size, Eona's Hearth can contain numerous houses, shops, and other buildings along its trunk and branches. 

## Population
Most of the population of Ithilmore lives within the tree.

## Government
Ithilmore is governed by the Council of Elders (see Key Figures of [[Kandallo]]).

## Defense
Ithilmore has no walls, moats, or traditional defenses. Instead, its main defense comes from the natural protection of the [[Willowdust Woods]]. It is nearly impossible for a force to surprise attack Ithilmore. If it does not alert a town or village along the way, the Elders would feel a disturbance from their natural connection to the woods. 

[[Kandallo]] still trains a military force to defend Ithilmore and settlements within the woods. These warriors are trained in a gorilla-style combat that utilizes their knowledge of the forest. 

## Commerce
- Exports to surrounding towns of [[Kandallo]]
- Stone mined from mountains to the NW
- Has sea routes with [[Opira]] and [[Yhora (City)]]
- Uses main river to bring goods into or out of the city
