## Government
Ithilmore is governed by the Council of Elders (see Key Figures of [[Kandallo]]).

## Defense
Ithilmore has no walls, moats, or traditional defenses. Instead, its main defense comes from the natural protection of the [[Willowdust Woods]]. It is nearly impossible for a force to surprise attack Ithilmore. If it does not alert a town or village along the way, the Elders would feel a disturbance from their natural connection to the woods. 

[[Kandallo]] still trains a military force to defend Ithilmore and settlements within the woods. These warriors are trained in a gorilla-style combat that utilizes their knowledge of the forest. 

## Commerce
