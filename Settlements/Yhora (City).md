# Yhora
Yhora ("Y-OR-UH") is a large city that is the capital of the [[Yhoran Empire]]. It sits at the mouth of [[Sea of Yhor]]. 

## Population
### Highgarden
Highgarden is the upper-class district of the city. It lays outside the gates of the Yhoran keep. Wealthy noble houses construct their grand dwellings here, in hope to become good terms with the royal family. 

### Merchant's Crossing
A large open square with several promenades extending out from it. The square itself, is filled with stalls and stands. Each promenade is lined with more permanent shops and businesses. Many merchants live above their respective shops. 

### Bloomfield
Most of the Yhoran population resides in what is named Bloomfield. They live as farmers, crafters, dockhands, and other simple laborers. Some farmers have homestead outside of the city walls, which is still considered Bloomfield. 

## Government
The Yhora family has maintained a monarchy for over two millennia. They rule not only the city of Yhora but the entire [[Yhoran Empire]]. The king has a council of masters that help him delegate tasks throughout the city and empire.  

## Defense
The core of the city is surrounded by stone walls. There are three gated entrances to the city: north, to the main road; east, towards the outer harbor; and southwest, towards the inner harbor. 

Centered in the city, the Yhoran Keep sits atop a hill, high enough to be seen anywhere within the city walls. The keep is surrounded by two stone walls, separated by a moat. 

Beyond static defenses, the city utilizes the Yhoran Guard, a vast army of soldiers. They protect the Yhora royal family, as well as the keep general law and order throughout the city.

## Commerce
Yhora is a major hub for trade, during and after the [[Yhoran Empire]]. The city is positioned on the mouth of the [[Sea of Yhor]], allowing sea trade routes to towns along the coast of the Sea and longer routes to other nations. 

Its main exports include manufactured goods and trained soldiers, usually to smaller settlements. 

Yhora imports mostly from the [[Opirian Alliance]], taking advantage of its variety of goods from different towns a part of the alliance. 

## Organizations
### Yhoran Guard
The Yhoran Guard are the main military force of the city. The guard is known for its large size. Within Yhora, they are mostly used to keep the peace. The guard's presence can be felt most prominent in both Highgarden and Merchant's Crossing: protecting the city's elite and trade above all else. 

A small, skilled sect of the guard protects the royal family directly, and are referred to as the Palace Guard. 

### Black Rose (Hidden)
The [[Black Rose]] is a thieves/assassins guild that hides in plain sight. It operates out of a tailor shop located in the Highgarden district.
