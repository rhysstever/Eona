## Deadly Criticals
When you score a critical hit, you do not deal double damage. Instead you maximise every dice you would have rolled for damage if it was a normal hit. You also roll an amount of dice equal to your proficiency bonus and add the results to the damage dealt. The size of the die is equal to the die associated with the attack.

Example: scoring a critical with a shortsword 
RAW Damage: 1d6 + modifier + 1d6
New Damage: 1d6 + modifier + 6

## System Shock
When a creature takes damage equal to, or greater than, half its Hit Point maximum, the creature must make a Constitution saving throw (DC15), rolling on the table below on a fail.

## Intense Death Saves
Rolling Death Saves should be a tense and climatic part of combat: someone's life is on the line. To make rolling Death Saving throws more intense, they are rolled privately and only shared with the DM. This creates suspense for the other players at the table, of not knowing how close someone is to actual death. For this to work, both the DM and the player rolling saves must not react to the results of the roll.
