# Student Schedules
Each year is split into two semesters. For each semester, students will take four courses (see block scheduling). These courses will be split between their main curriculum and electives. 

## Elective Courses
Elective Courses are offered in three levels: Beginner, Intermediate, and Advanced, also denoted levels I, II, and III, respectively. 

*Mechanics Notes*: upon completion of each level elective, a bonus will be gained by the character in the corresponding skill. Beginner courses grant proficiency, Intermediate courses grant expertise, and Advanced courses grant reliable talent.
