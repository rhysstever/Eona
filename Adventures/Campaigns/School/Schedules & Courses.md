# Courses
Courses are split into core courses and electives. In general, core courses will pertain to the adventurer's main program, including what they decide to specialize in (subclasses). Electives are designed to round out the adventurer's abilities that are not strictly related to their core program. 

## Core Courses
Core courses concentrate on core features and abilities. 

### Program Courses
All core program courses are half a year long. See the specific program's course page to see program-specific courses (TODO: rest of programs).

### Other Core Courses
Some core courses are required by multiple programs. These programs will share a key aspect in its development of the adventurer, such as spellcasting. These courses are usually an entire year long. The following are all such courses: 
- Fighting I^ (Unarmed Strike, Two-Weapon Fighting, Opportunity Attack, & basic weapon proficiencies)
- Fighting II (Extra Attack)
- Spellcasting I (Cantrips and 1st level spells)
- Spellcasting II (2nd level spells)
- Spellcasting III (3rd level spells)
- Spellcasting IV (4th level spells)

^course required for all programs

## Electives
Electives include skills courses and improvements, all ways of improving the adventurer outside of their core program. 

### Skill Electives
Skill electives are offered in three levels: Beginner, Intermediate, and Advanced, also denoted levels I, II, and III, respectively. Each skill course takes a full year of study. 

Upon completion of each elective, the adventurer will have learned valuable skills pertaining to the area of study. Beginner courses grant proficiency, Intermediate courses grant expertise, and Advanced courses grant reliable talent. For example, completing Intermediate Survival will result in expertise in the Survival skill. 

### Improvements
Throughout every program, adventurers are given the time to use their acquired skills to improve upon themselves, separate from their usual courses. Adventurers are encouraged to pick what best fits them. Whether its training the mind, body, or soul, it is their time to challenge themselves. 

**Individualized Study (Feats)**
As an alternative, adventurers can choose to do an individualized study. In order to do so, the adventurer must seek out a mentor who has a deep understanding in what the adventurer wishes to study. Mentors are usually staff or faculty of the school, but could also be a knowledgeable 4th year. 

# Schedules
Each school year is split into two semesters. Within a semester, adventurers will take a number of courses, split between core courses and electives. Generally, adventurers will have more courses in earlier semesters and years, and fewer later in their curriculum.
