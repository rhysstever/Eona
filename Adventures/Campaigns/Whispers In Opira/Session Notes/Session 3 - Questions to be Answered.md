## Ghosts of Kandallo
- As both rest, experience visions of Yher

- Thestros writes and sends out two letters
	- First: to his brother, [[King Xuan Vander Yhora]]
		- About the events that transpired and recommendation for actions that should be taken in response (mainly denouncing the [[Opirian Alliance]] for their failed security measures)
	- Second (secretive): to his connection of [[Order of Whispers]] 
		- Info on explosion- all personnel hit, some killed
		- Prepare for Phase 2
		- Might be exposed- unsure when next he can report 
- R asks Thestros about what Valor was like
- R, Myrdin, and Jason are brought in by Opirian guards for questioning 
	- When they arrived
