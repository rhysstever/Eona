> 
> We call out to the deities of Eona, to recognize those who have been ignored until now:
> 
> The Whispered One, the keeper of secrets. Leering around corners, sulking in alleyways, collecting knowledge only known to few. We worship you and live by your values. You showed us the evils of worldly governments, showed us why no one deserves such power. 
> 
> The Blood-driven, the vengeful. Giving us purpose and strength to do must must be done. What others would fail to do. You gave us the tools to destroy those in power. To topple the largest and strongest so that nothing remains. 
> 
> We stand before you all as devoted followers. 
> 
> We stand before you with an informer, leaking such secrets from their high position, to aid us in our work. 
> 
> We stand before you, with four silenced souls. Gatherers of knowledge, prized officials, and spreaders of information. 
> 
> We stand before you, with two more souls. Condemned for their values of knowledge. May you collect their souls and silence them for eternity. 
> 

- Thallan moves to sacrifice Jason and Sontar
- The unseen servant breaks Sontar out of his chains

## Combat
- Myrdin picks Jason out of chains
- Sontar rushes in, deals a ton of damage, but falls unconscious
	- In a last resort, he calls out to Yher
	- Sontar receives a vision of being back in the Life Web, and more clearly sees all of these cultists are the gray, muted beads wronging the cycle of life
	- Sontar comes back to consciousness
- Rolin buffs Sontar with Fizbin's Platinum Shield
- Myrdin gives Jason his rapier to use
- Xerthanos stays back in the hallway to cast from afar
- Jason later goes down, Ailin rushes up close to help him
	- From a combo of Thallan and Thestros, the 2 are trapped in a Forcecage with a bead for Delayed Fire Blast 
	- Ailin tries to protect the downed Jason as much as possible, both survive the blast (Jason just barely)
	- Ailin then stabilizes Jason

### Lair Actions
If the full monologue is said, Zaas's presence begins to take hold. Every round, roll a DC 19 check to determine if lair actions begin. The DC decreases by 2 every subsequent round:  
1) **Echoing Whispers.** Whispers echo through the chamber, every hostile creature needs to make a DC 13 Wisdom saving throw. A creature takes 2d6 psychic damage on a failed save, or half as much on a successful save. 
2) **Shrouds of Darkness.** A thick magical darkness forms in between horizontal or vertical pillars. If a creature attempts to walk through the magical darkness, the creature needs to make a DC 15 Charism saving throw. On a failed save, the creature's movement is reduced to 0 and they do not make it through the darkness. While the darkness is magical, spells and other magical effects can still pass through. 
3) **Silenced Laughter.** Zaas's influence peaks within the room. Every creature within room must make a DC 13 Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, a creature is silenced for one round. A silenced creature can not speak and cannot cast any spells that require a verbal component. 

## Post-Combat
- Thestros is stabilized and chained to the wall
	- Myrdin wakes him up, asks Sontar to break his leg
	- Sontar crits, and Thestros dies of shock and blood loss
- The Forcecage eventually drops, and Jason is able to receive some healing
- Kandallan group: Xerthanos, Sontar, Rolin, and Ailin teleport (via Rolin) back to [[Ithilmore]]
- Jason recognizes the other sacrificed body as Alais Boon, a fellow Black Rose agent, based in the Opirian Alliance
- Jason searches Thestros, finding Valor's ring, giving it to R as they walk out
- Myrdin, Jason, and R leave the basement, tell a guard, and the [[Opirian Alliance]] begin another investigation into the matter
	- The only point they change is making Thestros among the victims (as the same as Folen and Alais)

## Epilogue
- Myrdin, Jason, and R make their way back to [[Yhora (City)]]
	- Myrdin and Jason report back to [[Black Rose]], detailing all of the events
- The Yhora family denounces the security of [[Opira]] after hearing of Thestros's death
	- Myrdin is fired as the royal bard, leaves [[Yhora (City)]] to go find his missing cousin
	- Jason and the other guards are fired, he asks the [[Black Rose]] to be relocated to [[Kandallo]]
	- R is moved to a different high up position, away from the royal family
	- Tensions rise between the [[Yhorian Empire]] and [[Opirian Alliance]]
