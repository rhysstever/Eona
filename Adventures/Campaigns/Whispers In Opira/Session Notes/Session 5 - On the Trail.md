# Session 5 - On the Trail

Date: 04/11/2022  
Players: [[Myrdin Craynore]], [[Arthic Daeren]], [[Sontar Raloran]], [[Xerthanos Sparklecloak]], and [[Jason Stonewall]]  

In-Game Date: Day 20 of Eonum, 1452

## Planning the Plan
- The group talks about what to do in Myrdin's room
- R returns ~an hour later after talking with other representatives (see [[Session 4.5 - New Expectations]] notes)
- Xerthanos sets an Alarm spell, allowing only the group, Kevin, and Thestros
- R opens up to Xerthanos, apologizing for how they acted before and shares some knowledge they have
- R asks Sontar and Xerthanos to leave to talk about the response letter to Thestros that R peeked at and did not give him the letter
- Xerthanos sets an alarm in both Jason's and R's rooms, then disguises himself as a coat rack with Disguise Self (also writes an illusionary script to R on the mirror)

## Checking On Folen
- The group (except from Xerthanos) goes to Folen Carro's room, looking for answers about the explosion
	- R leads the way
	- Myrdin knocks twice, no response (BTS: cultists hides)
	- The group does a loop around the keep, finding nothing of importance, returning to Folen's door

## Discussing What's Next
- R asks an Opirian guard, Alwin, about talking to Uga and where Folen is, while Myrdin checks outside
- R talks to Thestros and gives him the response letter
- Everyone regroups (except for Xerthanos ("Coat-thanos")) in Myrdin's room
	- Xerthanos writes “R must stand for Really Awesome -Xerthanos, the Leonin” on R's mirror in illusionary script
- Sontar goes back to his room to pray to Yher
	- Asks for another vision

## Another Note from Yher
- The night of 20th of Eonum: Yher's response to Xerthanos's prayers:
- Xerthanos wakes up in a void of darkness, illuminated by glowing white beads strung together
	- Each bead, when examined is a person's life: a "time lapse" of them being born, growing up, and passing
	- Feelings of comfort and certainty
- Notices a small group of "muted" beads, of a dark gray
	- When examined, sees rituals and hears prays to the Whispered One
	- Sees the chain of life broken as someone is raised from the dead
		- The humanoid appears more feral, a different consciousness
	- Feelings of anger and hatred when seeing these scenes

## Behind the Scenes
- By the Evening of the 20th: Order of Whispers: Folen's room is cleaned up
