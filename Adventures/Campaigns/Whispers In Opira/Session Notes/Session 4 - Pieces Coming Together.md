## Nighttime Visions
- Xerthanos and Sontar have 2 different night terrors while they sleep
- Xerthanos: Being taken and killed 
	- Kidnapped and chained by masked and cloaked figures
		- Figures are all wearing matching dark robes and masks with only holes for eyes- the mouth is crossed over as if to silence the wearer 
	- Approached by a "higher ranked" figure, who reaches out their hand toward you and whispers this phrase:
		- "May your knowledge die as secrets, collected by the Whispered One"
	- Dark gray energy begins to pull out of your body back to this figure
	- Your body begins to feel like the life essence is being taken from it- fingertips begin to lose color and turn a gray, which spread to your hands and arms
	- As your life escapes you, you lose consciousness, **see End of both visions** 
- Sontar: Taking another's life essence
	- You are walking in a dark hallway with other figures
	- Your vision is narrowed from a mask and the figures you're walking with have similar masks on (see above for description)
	- Make several turns before entering a small room with 2 other masked figures and a captive
	- You look over this captive and the phrase escapes you and you feel the life force of this being leave their body and enter yours
	- As you close your eyes to revel in this new feeling of power and energy, **see End of both visions**
- End of both visions: Both have their visions reopen to the vision of Yher once more, a massive full moon behind a lone gravestone atop a small hill
