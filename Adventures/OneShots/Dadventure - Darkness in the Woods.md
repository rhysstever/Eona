## Prelude
Airen, a small village nestled amongst the dense forest of the [[Willowdust Woods]]. It lays just off the main path, hidden and unknown to the novice traveler. Airen is a simple town, a tight community, known for its beautiful flowers and delicious legumes. 

Today is a brisk, yet slow morning. It is the first of Meralum and most of the townsfolk, and even some of the wildlife, is starting the morning late after last night's festivities. The entire town had gathered on a large hill, just on the other side of the grove to watch a fantastic light show put on by the local wizard, Aelo, and their apprentice Tinga. Since then, townsfolk have started taking down some of the decorations, wooden stalls that sold all kinds of sweets are now being deconstructed and put away until the next event, and most are resuming their normal day-to-day tasks. 

We now come to you, Ilyphar, walking along the main path. You are a lean elf, slightly taller than average. Middle-aged for an elf, but for your physique certainly much more than capable. You have lived in Airen for a number of years now, though that only feels like a few months due to your elven lifespan. 

You enjoy the quiet out here. Much more than the hustle and bustle of the capital of [[Ithilmore]]. Out here you can go for a simple walk for no other reason than to get lost and make a journey out of finding your way back. You feel more in touch with your fey ancestry out here. Sometimes when you're deep in the forest, you sit amongst the leaves and vines and can swear you hear whispers in the trees. Traveling up and down the trunks, as if messages are being sent through their roots. 

When you moved here, you took a position to protect the town from outside dangers. You had come up with the idea with your two lifelong friends: Gorgirk and Meckal, who joined you in Airen. The three of you had met in [[Ithilmore]] and had gone of numerous adventures, but all agreed you wanted to get away from the big tree. 

You make your way away into the woods, joined soon by both of your old friends. The three of you talk amongst yourselves about the fun you all had last night. You watch birds fly above the canopies and small creatures scurry along tree branches. 

## Encounter
After sometime, you get to a small gravesite below a large tree. You have seen this gravesite before, one of the many milestones you use as a way to navigate the forest. This gravesite however, has been desecrated. Strange markings have been scrawled on each of the three graves and lit candles are placed around in a circle. 

Before any of you can act, the ground in front of each of the graves begins to move. From the soil, you see rotted, colorless fingers. The ground fully upheavals and standing before you are 3 undead creatures: 2 are smaller and ghoulish and 1 is larger and hulking (1 ghast and 2 ghouls).
